<div id="welcome" class="section level1">
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Welcome to the blog! My main purpose in creating this site is to show those doing I-O Psychology and Human Resources (HR) type work, the way that I use R, Python, and occasionally Tableau in my work.</p>
<p>This can cover several of the topics listed below among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>data wrangling</li>
<li>data visualization</li>
<li>data imputation</li>
<li>data modeling</li>
<li>traditional statistics</li>
<li>machine learning</li>
<li>model deployment</li>
<li>dashboards</li>
<li>automation</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the post I come across on these types of tasks use anything but HR type data that I can relate to. So, I’m hoping that if you have stopped by here, you can get a head start on applying some of the previously mentioned topics to your work.</p>

<div id="about-me" class="section level1">
<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I got my BA in Psychology from the University of Georgia and then my Master’s and Ph.D. from the University of South Florida in Industrial-Organizational Psychology. In my work career, I’ve done a good deal of survey work along with validation studies, assessment creation, and both internal and external consulting.</p>
<p>I’m also currently teaching advanced analytics in R to Master’s level students with a large emphasis on applicability (e.g. model interpretability, explainability, and return on investment). I want to give my students skills that are immediately applicable in the workplace.</p>

<h1>Programming background</h1>
<p>Very little! I came from SPSS and after hitting one too many walls with what I was trying to do with my analysis, slowly started picking up R. I’m a loquacious coder who usually writes more comments than code, but that has saved my bacon 6 months to a year down the road on many occasions. I encourage you to comment on the different ways that you would have handled the particular task I’ve blogged about because on several occasions I have someone point out a new or different method that has saved me several hours of work.</p>
